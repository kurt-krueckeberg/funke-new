== Phases of Corrections to the Funke Document

The goal is to first have a completely accurate transliteration, thereafter
to modernize the spelling, and finally produce an accurate idiomatic modern
German version whose meaning is the same as the original.

The fourth phase is to use Deepl.com to translated it.

=== Phase 1 — Textual Accuracy

Proofread each image against your transliteration

* Correct paleographic errors

* Resolve ambiguous readings

* Do not rewrite structure

Result: a reliable base text.

=== Phase 2 — Orthographic Modernization

Then we:

* Modernize spelling and number formatting consistently

* Normalize punctuation

* Preserve syntax

* Avoid interpretive reconstruction

Result: a modernized but structurally faithful text.

=== Phase 3 — Idiomatic Modern German

Only after we have the complete, verified text (including page-spanning sentences), we:

* Rewrite paragraph by paragraph

* Modernize syntax and phrasing

* Keep all content

* Avoid guessing at broken sentences

* Possibly work sentence-by-sentence to maintain control

These transliteration files have been checked by ChatGPT and myself for
accuracy, and corrections have been made. The final version has been
committed and ChatGPT has asssured it is 100% accurate. 


TODO: R

* recheck 01-11 for all the details in included in Phase II.
