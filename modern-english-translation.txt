On the Conditions of the Einlieger in the Principalities of Lippe-Detmold and Schaumburg-Lippe

By Pastor Georg Funke in Menslage near Osnabrück

According to the census of 1846 (Zeitschrift für deutsche Statistik 1847,
p. 1059), the Principality of Lippe-Detmold supports 106,046 inhabitants on
an area of 20.6 square miles.

In 1834 the population stood at 98,428 (97,720), and by 1840 it had risen
to 104,462. The average rate of increase may therefore be estimated at 0.7
percent. On average, 5,148 inhabitants live on each square mile. This is a
population density found in only a few German states. Only the Kingdom of
Saxony (with 6,760 inhabitants per square mile), the Grand Duchy of Hesse
(5,578 per square mile), the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg (5,367 per square
mile), and the Principality of Reuss-Greiz (5,170 per square mile) are more
densely populated.

If we consider that the Principality of Lippe is by no means uniformly
fertile or fully cultivated, but rather is mountainous and therefore often
resistant to agricultural development; that it contains extensive forests
and stretches of heath; and that it includes only small towns—then we must
conclude that quite particular conditions must exist which make it possible
for the country to sustain such a dense population. This is especially
striking because neither commerce nor manufacturing is of great
significance there.

These distinctive conditions become apparent when we examine the situation
of the so-called Einlieger, who were mentioned not long ago in this journal
(p. 639) as lacking the right to vote in municipal affairs.

1. Origin of the Einlieger

Since the end of the previous century, the landless rural population in the
Principality of Lippe has increased to such an extent that, as is also the
case in the Principality of Osnabrück, it exceeds the landowning population
by approximately two to one.

In our region these landless rural inhabitants are called Heuerleute or
Heuerlinge, from heuern, that is, to rent for one year (heuer meaning “for
this year”). In Lippe they are called Einlieger, because they lodge with
others—that is, they reside in the households of others.

These Einlieger, who at present constitute approximately two-thirds of the
entire rural population, existed in the Principality of Lippe only in very
small numbers until the middle of the previous century, and in some
districts not at all.

Up to that time, younger sons of farm owners who did not have the
opportunity to marry onto other farms or to enter into other forms of
livelihood would either settle on a still uncultivated site within a
village, or establish themselves on the common lands belonging to the
village, also known as heaths.

In this way many small landholders came into being. Indeed, as the common
lands were gradually brought under cultivation, small settlements even
developed, usually named after the villages or estates from which the
colonization had proceeded (Hölserheide, Herserheide, Wülferheide, etc.).

In general, there prevails in Lippe a preference for living together in
villages rather than in scattered farming hamlets, as is more typical in
Westphalia proper, where farms are situated at greater or lesser distances
from one another. Nevertheless, the villages of Lippe are not arranged in
the tightly clustered manner found in regions where the Enger and
Eastphalian settlement pattern appears in its pure form, in contrast to the
Westphalian type.

The small landholders who emerged later—called Neubauer, Neuwohner, or, in
popular speech, Hoppenplöcker—possessed, prior to the division of the
common lands, with few exceptions, virtually no land beyond a small garden
plot. This plot was probably assigned to them at the time they received
permission to establish their holdings.

In the preface to my work On the Present Condition of the Heuerleute in the
Principality of Osnabrück, with Particular Reference to the Causes of Their
Decline and with Consideration of the Means for Their Elevation (Bielefeld,
1847), I called for communications concerning the condition of the landless
rural population in northwestern Germany, since I intend to present a more
comprehensive account of the circumstances of this class of people, who are
living in great distress.

Such communications have already been received from several quarters, for
which I here publicly express my thanks; however, they are still lacking
from many regions. I therefore repeat my earlier request and add that such
communications— for which I shall express my gratitude by sending a copy of
the forthcoming work—may be reliably transmitted to me through the
booksellers Hahn in Hanover and Rackhorst in Osnabrück.

The present article has been prepared on the basis of private
communications received.

At first they supported themselves by working as day laborers on the farms,
and they also placed their children there as servants. As their numbers
continued to increase, the work they found within the country was no longer
sufficient for their maintenance. They therefore sought employment abroad
and turned, like their neighbors in proper Westphalia, toward Holland, West
Friesland, Groningen, and the adjacent regions. It is well known that in
those times, when commercial activity in the United Netherlands was
significant, manual labor there brought substantial profit because there
was a shortage of workers. As soon as the sons had grown up, they followed
their fathers.

Through this temporary emigration of the working population during the
summer, a shortage of laborers arose in their homeland, particularly in the
season when farms were most in need of outside assistance. As in our own
Osnabrück region, farm owners frequently complained about this and appealed
to the government to place restrictions on this temporary emigration.

Möser remarks in this connection that landowners believed the state existed
for their sake. It is therefore no wonder that they thought the state must
provide them with workers willing to serve for low wages by prohibiting the
practice of going to Holland.

Moreover, as in Osnabrück, so also in Lippe, the government did not reject
the complaints raised on this account but acknowledged them as justified.
We are not able to cite a specific ordinance for Lippe; however, we have
been informed that such regulations were issued, though without success. It
was likely no different here than in our former bishopric. As early as
1608, Bishop Philipp Sigismund stated before the Estates that complaints
had been received concerning servants and laborers, that no one wished to
enter service, thereby placing hereditary farmers and townspeople in
difficulty; rather, unmarried people departed at their own discretion to
Friesland and elsewhere outside the bishopric, where they could earn more
in a shorter time, and later returned again at their own discretion;
furthermore, the wages of laborers were excessive, and so forth, so that
careful consideration should be given to whether a police ordinance ought
not to be issued for such cases.

Although we believe that in earlier times many sources of livelihood were
still available within the country itself, it was in any case wrong to
attempt to restrict earning opportunities abroad by police measures merely
so that the settled inhabitants might obtain cheap day laborers and
servants. It was entirely natural that such measures produced no results.

The consequence of this temporary emigration in Lippe was the emergence of
the so-called Einlieger. In order to secure laborers, farm owners, as the
population increased, gradually began to take married persons into their
dwellings as tenants (that is, to let them “lie in” with them), on the
condition that they would work for a fixed daily wage whenever required. At
first there were no separate dwellings for the Einlieger. Vacant retirement
houses (Leibzuchtshäuser) were initially used. Later, however, special
houses had to be built, usually arranged for two families. These are now
found on almost all farm holdings (Kolonate).

The extent to which this propertyless population of Einlieger has increased
in recent times in Lippe may be shown by the following example: a farm
owner informed me that in 1772, when his grandfather married into the farm
he now possesses, there were only five or six Einlieger in that village; in
1846, however, when he compiled the Einlieger list, their number had risen
to 110.

By contrast, the number of landowners was relatively small. Among
thirty-nine there were only ten larger farmers (Kolonen) who kept four or
more horses, and ten others, each of whom cultivated twenty to sixty
(Lippe) Scheffelsaat, partly with cows; the remainder were small
proprietors (Hoppenplöcker), who owned no land beyond the portions of the
commons that had fallen to them or merely their small gardens; in addition,
there was also a noble estate there.

The general division of the commons must be regarded as a consequence of
the increase in the number of Einlieger. The Einlieger simply drove their
livestock onto the common pastures, so that these—especially since Lippe as
a whole possesses little pastureland—were excessively grazed and yielded
little as common pasture (Hude). Not without reason did the small
landowners complain that the larger ones, with their own livestock and the
additional livestock of their Einlieger, made disproportionately heavy use
of the commons.

These constant complaints led almost everywhere to the gradual division of
the commons in order to be rid of them. Given the dense population of the
country and the generally small benefit that the commons yielded in this
poorly irrigated region, the division may have been appropriate insofar as
it brought new land under cultivation, even though it did not improve the
condition of the Einlieger.

We are not in favor of unconditional division of the commons, as occurred
in the Principality of Osnabrück in most cases without necessity; rather,
we believe that a limited division, proportionate to the increased
population, would have brought greater advantages. Nevertheless, we readily
acknowledge that in Lippe, where such large commons as exist here with us
did not exist at all, circumstances were essentially different. Since the
terrain in Lippe is generally not well suited for pasture, the divided
commons, when cultivated, will certainly yield on average twice as much as
before. Some areas, of course, will remain that either entirely resist
cultivation or produce returns only if already existing productive forces
can be directed into them in order to stimulate new ones.

2. The Sources of Livelihood of the Einlieger

The manual-laboring classes in the Principality of Lippe—including not only
the Einlieger but also the small landowners who live under the same
conditions—support themselves primarily through the linen industry and,
secondly, through brickmaking work abroad.

a. In the previously cited work “On the Condition of the Heuerleute, etc.”
we discussed the general decline of the linen industry. What we stated
there also applies to Lippe. At present, even with the greatest diligence,
a manual-laboring family can no longer support itself solely through
domestic production of flax or hemp, in view of the expanding machine
spinning and weaving. Spinning and weaving are now to be regarded only as
secondary occupations.

Even earlier, however, the linen industry in Lippe was less significant
than in Ravensberg, Minden, Osnabrück, and similar regions; therefore, the
decline of the German linen trade has not had such far-reaching harmful
consequences as in those areas, where the propertyless population was often
entirely dependent on income from spinning and weaving and where, under
altered circumstances, no work has yet been found to replace this domestic
industry and likely will not be found. England has, as is well known,
almost everywhere excluded us from the linen trade, so that in the end only
Cuba remained for the sale of our products, and England has meanwhile also
pressed into that market. With the continually expanding cotton production
in America, matters have also reached the point that even in the West
Indies cotton fabrics have in part displaced linen ones.

This, however, can only occur to a certain extent, since for tropical
countries there is no clothing more suitable than linen, which is both
highly durable and cooling. It is therefore to be expected that, despite
the machines, a more favorable period will return for the domestic linen
industry once the political conditions of tropical America have become more
stable and provided that we do not neglect to establish favorable direct
trade connections with it. On the one hand, hand-spun linen, because of its
greater strength and durability and its other advantages, will maintain
itself alongside machine-made linen; on the other hand, the industry of the
propertyless population will turn toward the more careful preparation of
flax for machine processing.

In Lippe, according to the statement of a farmer (Kolon), about twenty to
thirty years ago twelve skeins of so-called purchase yarn were delivered
for one thaler; at present fifteen to eighteen skeins are given for one
thaler. It has been asserted that the difference in earnings cannot be
quite so great, since nowadays spinning is done consistently with both
hands, which was formerly not the case. It must, however, be noted that
although four skeins of yarn may now be spun with two hands instead of the
earlier two or two and a half, this yarn is of inferior quality, and at
times as many as thirty-six skeins have had to be delivered for one thaler.
In spinning with two hands, naturally twice as much flax is required. If
this flax is purchased, one receives seven pounds uncleaned for one thaler,
of which approximately four to five pounds remain after cleaning; from this
the spinner, with difficulty, can spin only thirty-six skeins.
Consequently, the work would have to be done entirely without pay if only
one thaler is given for thirty-six skeins.

Meanwhile, even at higher yarn prices, earnings are so low that a family
dependent on spinning alone cannot survive. Usually the flax is not
purchased but grown by the Einlieger and small landowners themselves; in
that case, however, they must rent land suitable for flax cultivation, buy
flaxseed, and in a period when manual labor is well paid, devote their
labor power to preparing the flax. There is still some profit when the flax
is grown oneself, since one’s own labor is valued less highly than it would
otherwise be paid; nevertheless, there are also many areas where flax does
not thrive particularly well or at all, so that the only option remaining
is to buy it raw if one wishes to engage in spinning during spare hours.
Not infrequently, larger landowners cultivate flax on their fields for
their Einlieger at a low price. Likewise, servants employed by larger
landowners receive some flax to cultivate. Much remains to be desired with
regard to the processing of flax; however, greater care has recently been
devoted to spinning. If spinning is done with both hands, only very
ordinary yarn can be delivered.

b. A quite distinctive source of income for the manual-laboring population
of Lippe is brickmaking work abroad, or the so-called “going to Holland”
(Hollandsgehen). Just as in the northern Osnabrück region the peat diggers
who go to Holstein, Schleswig, Brandenburg, East and West Prussia, and to
Posen are called “Denmark-goers” because they originally went first to
Holstein and Schleswig, so in Lippe all brickworkers abroad are called
“Holland-goers” or “Frisians,” because they originally went to Holland and
Friesland, although a very large portion of them now emigrates temporarily
in the opposite direction. Lipper men also go as peat diggers to West
Friesland and Groningen, more rarely as other kinds of laborers, for
example as grass cutters, gardeners, masons, carpenters, glue boilers, and
so forth, as occurs in the Principality of Osnabrück.

Brickmaking has from early times been practiced by the lower classes in the
Principality of Lippe; for about twenty-five years it has shifted from the
small landowners more to the Einlieger. As a result of the division of the
commons, the former received parcels which, although not particularly
large, were often quite suitable for cultivation and which they now farmed.
This internal colonization kept only the small landowners at home, since
agriculture, which had formerly been their secondary occupation, now became
their principal occupation. Since brickmaking has passed more to the
Einlieger, it has further expanded. The trade is native to Lippe, and skill
in it appears to be transmitted from one generation to the next; therefore,
this work on foreign brickyards may well be regarded as secure for the
future.

Altogether, approximately 400,000 thalers are brought into the country
annually through this activity. Even if earnings are weak in some regions
at times, the government-appointed messengers (Botenmeister or brick
messengers) always know how to discover new opportunities. Two Botenmeister
are appointed for Friesland and Holland; they conclude contracts there and
recruit workers in Lippe. In this way each brickworker is secured in
respect of his earnings; for if contracts are not fulfilled, he may seek
recourse from the Botenmeister, who is obliged to represent him before the
authorities. The Botenmeister travel to Friesland (that is, West Friesland
and Groningen) and to Holland twice a year, once to conclude the contracts
and then again to supervise their fulfillment during the work.

An adult brickworker earns, depending on whether circumstances are more or
less favorable, during the six months of his absence forty to sixty thalers
in net cash. Individual masters not infrequently bring back more than one
hundred, sometimes even two hundred thalers. In dry summers, when the clay
from which the bricks are made dries quickly and therefore can be fired
more frequently, earnings are highest.

Of lesser importance is the other manual labor performed by Lippe Einlieger
in “Friesland”; this consists chiefly of peat digging. Earnings are lower,
but these peat diggers also remain away from home for a shorter time. In
about three months they now earn fifteen to twenty, at most twenty-five
thalers; they depart in April and return toward the end of June or July.
Their work, however, is more arduous and less healthy, since it must be
done in wet conditions.

[Footnote]

The reviewer has often traversed on foot the classical soil of the
Principality of Lippe, where Hermann once defeated Varus and where now, on
the summit of the Teutoburg Forest, the monument of the German
hero—unfortunately not yet completed—rises. On one such occasion he once
encountered an Einlieger who told him that he had formerly gone to
Friesland as a peat digger. He estimated his earnings at about twenty
thalers; sometimes he had still had to deduct travel expenses from this,
sometimes he had also had somewhat more. This worker may serve as an
example of how little money is required to make the journey from Lippe to
Friesland. He stated that on the outward journey, when he took some
provisions from home, he had not needed a full thaler; on the return
journey, when these were lacking, he had not always managed with that
amount. Meanwhile, on the road they had mostly eaten only bread; only once,
namely in Haselünne, where they had always taken quarters with a butcher,
had they eaten a warm evening meal. The meal had been so good that it need
not have been better even at a wedding; they had received soup with beef
and then sauerkraut with bacon or ham. Including the night’s lodging (on
hay) and the coffee enjoyed the next morning, seven marks had been paid in
total. That was not excessive, but the journey would have become too
expensive if they had incurred such an expense for every night’s lodging.
One sees what privations these workers endure on the road.
