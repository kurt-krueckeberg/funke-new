On the Conditions of the Einlieger in the Principalities of Lippe-Detmold
and Schaumburg-Lippe

By Pastor Georg Funke in Menslage near Osnabrück

According to the census of 1846 (Zeitschrift für deutsche Statistik 1847,
p. 1059), the Principality of Lippe-Detmold supports 106,046 inhabitants on
an area of 20.6 square miles.

In 1834 the population stood at 98,428 (97,720), and by 1840 it had risen
to 104,462. The average rate of increase may therefore be estimated at 0.7
percent. On average, 5,148 inhabitants live on each square mile. This is a
population density found in only a few German states. Only the Kingdom of
Saxony (with 6,760 inhabitants per square mile), the Grand Duchy of Hesse
(5,578 per square mile), the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg (5,367 per square
mile), and the Principality of Reuss-Greiz (5,170 per square mile) are more
densely populated.

If we consider that the Principality of Lippe is by no means uniformly
fertile or fully cultivated, but rather is mountainous and therefore often
resistant to agricultural development; that it contains extensive forests
and stretches of heath; and that it includes only small towns—then we must
conclude that quite particular conditions must exist which make it possible
for the country to sustain such a dense population. This is especially
striking because neither commerce nor manufacturing is of great
significance there.

These distinctive conditions become apparent when we examine the situation
of the so-called Einlieger, who were mentioned not long ago in this journal
(p. 639) as lacking the right to vote in municipal affairs.

1. Origin of the Einlieger

Since the end of the previous century, the landless rural population in the
Principality of Lippe has increased to such an extent that, as is also the
case in the Principality of Osnabrück, it exceeds the landowning population
by approximately two to one.

In our region these landless rural inhabitants are called Heuerleute or
Heuerlinge, from heuern, that is, to rent for one year (heuer meaning “for
this year”). In Lippe they are called Einlieger, because they lodge with
others—that is, they reside in the households of others.

These Einlieger, who at present constitute approximately two-thirds of the
entire rural population, existed in the Principality of Lippe only in very
small numbers until the middle of the previous century, and in some
districts not at all.

Up to that time, younger sons of farm owners who did not have the
opportunity to marry onto other farms or to enter into other forms of
livelihood would either settle on a still uncultivated site within a
village, or establish themselves on the common lands belonging to the
village, also known as heaths.

In this way many small landholders came into being. Indeed, as the common
lands were gradually brought under cultivation, small settlements even
developed, usually named after the villages or estates from which the
colonization had proceeded (Hölserheide, Herserheide, Wülferheide, etc.).

In general, there prevails in Lippe a preference for living together in
villages rather than in scattered farming hamlets, as is more typical in
Westphalia proper, where farms are situated at greater or lesser distances
from one another. Nevertheless, the villages of Lippe are not arranged in
the tightly clustered manner found in regions where the Enger and
Eastphalian settlement pattern appears in its pure form, in contrast to the
Westphalian type.

The small landholders who emerged later—called Neubauer, Neuwohner, or, in
popular speech, Hoppenplöcker—possessed, prior to the division of the
common lands, with few exceptions, virtually no land beyond a small garden
plot. This plot was probably assigned to them at the time they received
permission to establish their holdings.

Footnote

In the preface to my work On the Present Condition of the Heuerleute in the
Principality of Osnabrück, with Particular Reference to the Causes of Their
Decline and with Consideration of the Means for Their Elevation (Bielefeld,
1847), I called for communications concerning the condition of the landless
rural population in northwestern Germany, since I intend to present a more
comprehensive account of the circumstances of this class of people, who are
living in great distress.

Such communications have already been received from several quarters, for
which I here publicly express my thanks; however, they are still lacking
from many regions. I therefore repeat my earlier request and add that such
communications— for which I shall express my gratitude by sending a copy of
the forthcoming work—may be reliably transmitted to me through the
booksellers Hahn in Hanover and Rackhorst in Osnabrück.

The present article has been prepared on the basis of private
communications received.
