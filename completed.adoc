== Phases of Corrections to the Funke Document

The goal is to first have a completely accurate transliteration, thereafter
to modernize the spelling, and finally produce an accurate idiomatic modern
German version whose meaning is the same as the original.

The fourth phase is to use Deepl.com to translated it.

=== Phase 1 — Textual Accuracy

Proofread each image against your transliteration and:

* Correct paleographic errors

* Resolve ambiguous readings

* Do not rewrite structure

Result: a reliable base text.

=== Phase 2 — Orthographic Modernization

Then we:

* Modernize spelling and number formatting consistently

* Normalize punctuation

* Preserve syntax

* Avoid interpretive reconstruction

Result: a modernized but structurally faithful text.

=== Phase 3 — Idiomatic Modern German

This is another part of a multi-part transliteration of an 1848
German Fraktur article entitled " Über die Verhältnisse der Einlieger in
den Fürstentümern Lippe-Detmold und Schaumburg-Lippe". Please translate it
paragraph by paragraph into English. Do not paraphrase. Do
not summarize or abridge. The goal is a easier to read text than the German
text, so that it is more understandable. To achieve this aim, you
should do this:

1. Modernize syntax and phrasing
2. Keep all content
3. Avoid guessing at broken sentences
4. Possibly work sentence-by-sentence to maintain control

Display the entire result, the entire modernize translation.
